## There were two years in which the General Social Survey asked about the frequency of eating out. The variable name you are looking for is "eatout".
### Find those years and for the first year the question was asked download that years data in a stata format - its name will be "GSSxxxx.dta" where the xxxx is replaced by the year.  For example if the year was 1983 its name would be GSS1983.dta. Your assignment is to download the GSS yearly dataset for the first year the question was asked and then  write up the answer to the question by editing the  code block in line 31 to eval=TRUE and finish the job. 

$H_0$ There is no difference among the various races with frequency of eating out  
$H_A$ There is a statistical difference between at least two races with the frequency of eating out  


# Methods

  Looking at the data and the question posed,we are comparing two categorical data types and will use the cat-cat helper file to answer the question of whether there is a statistical difference between races and the frequency of eating out.


```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source(file="fisherXY.R")
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require(haven)
require(knitr)
require(foreign)
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
GSS <-read_dta(file="GSS1996.dta")
GSS <- readstata13::read.dta13(file="GSS1996.dta")
GSS <- droplevels(GSS)
mydata <- select(GSS,race,age,eatout)
mydata <- na.omit(mydata)
```


# Plots

```{r}
barchartGC(~race + eatout,data=mydata)
barchartGC(~race + eatout,data=mydata, type="percent")

```

 From the previous data, we can see the white race has a higher frequency of eating out than blacks and other races. However, the black race has a lower frequency for not eating out, when compared to whites and the other races. The other races represented in the graph had a median statistical rate when compared to the white and black races.



# Numerical


```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~race + eatout, data=mydata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

The white race has a 82.83% rate of eating out. The black race has a 68.75% rate of eating out. And the other races share a 77.78%  rate of eating out.

# Inferential 

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```

Based on the previous data, we noticed a statistical difference between each data set.

```{r}
fisherXY(mydata$race,mydata$eatout,printAll = TRUE)
```

When the Fisher XY test was first run, it resulted in a low p-value between the white and black races. On the second test run, after adding the print equals true value, the values were significantly higher.


# Discussion & Conclusion


In conclusion, the data suggests there is a statistical difference in the frequency between the white and black races in eating out. The graphical and numerical results indicated that white race eats out at a higher frequency than the blacks and other races. The critical p-value confirmed there is a difference in the frequency of the white and black races eating out. Therefore we can conclude the alternative hypothosis is correct.
